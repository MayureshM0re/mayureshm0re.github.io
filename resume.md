EDUCATION
University of Mumbai	Mumbai
Bachelor of Engineering - Computer Science 	12th July 2023
GPA : 8.04/10

WORK EXPERIENCE
Witsense AI	 Remote
AI Engineer	March 2024 - September 2025

Engineered an end-to-end auto-annotation system using GroundingDINO + Grounded-SAM, generating production-ready YOLO datasets with integrated YOLOv8/YOLO11 pipelines and downloadable PyTorch weights.

Architected serverless MLOps infrastructure (AWS SQS, Lambda, Batch, S3) and built FastAPI + PostgreSQL REST APIs for image uploads, automated annotation workflows, and GPU training pipelines — reducing deployment latency by 40%.

Trained custom YOLOv8/YOLO11 detectors (door handles, top-view people, uncommon objects), achieving 99.5 mAP@50 through optimized dataset annotation and fine-tuning.

Optimized models for edge devices (Raspberry Pi 5, Coral USB) — reducing size by 80% and achieving 5× faster inference.

Developed a ROS 2-based Search & Rescue UAV integrating Gazebo/ArduPilot SITL, Cartographer SLAM, and a custom Ground Control Station with telemetry + CV pipelines.

Built a high-performance upscaling pipeline with Real-ESRGAN + FSRCNN, improving PSNR by 25% over traditional methods.

Led daily stand-ups as Scrum Master and mentored 2 junior engineer through feature development and delivery.
